WSN
===================
 
This is a repository hosting source codes of a wireless sensor network project. This project is initiated by a NUS master project module. This repository contains two parts, namely 'gateway' and 'endpoint'.

Gateway
----------
This folder contains the source codes related to gateway. In this version, a Beaglebone Black (BBB) single-board computer is used as the gateway device. The gateway is running Debian OS with customized image for BBB. 

Endpoint
----------
This folder contains the source codes related to the endpoints. In this project, endpoints are implemented based on CC2530 wireless MCU from TI. Actually TI provides full stacks of ZigBee applications. However, there are some limitations in porting over these full stacks into our required specifications.
